# Use Cases

These are examples of events, and some of them might move the map, some do not. They are selected for being different from each others.

# Easy

Use Case: The oldest kiln ever to be found has been made at Yarim Tepe (~6000 BCE)
Type: Innovation (?) (CIDOC E29, E22)
Challenges: the date is quite unclear. The maker is unclear. It being 'first' is quiet questionable too.

Use Case: Elam if founded by Elamites (~4200 BCE)
Type: Founded/Formed (CIDOC E63, E66, E71)
Challenges: Were they called Elamites before founding Elam? Time is again a bit uncertain.

Use Case: Eridu is a considered the biggest city on the planet with 10,000 people (~3700 BCE)
Type: Record / Demographic Data Point
Challenges: What exactly is this? We certainly don't have very solid data this far back so it can't just be a rolling average. Very challenging to model, if also extremely interesting.

Use Case: Cuneiform Script emerges somewhere in Sumeria (~3100 BCE)
Type: Innovation (CIDOC E29)
Challenges: The date is somewhat unclear, but now the event is not just unknown in location, it's distributed. Also, it's the type of event that even in reality doesn't have a hard date, as we're looking at the consequence of a process more than anything (maybe a formal book of cuneiform was published and would for a nice atomic event, but we certainly don't know of one)

Use Case: Gilgamesh ascends to the throne of Uruk in Uruk (~2700 BCE)
Type: Ascends to a Role (CIDOC ??)
Challenges: Unclear date, and there's uncertainty about the location too, and no CIDOC code

Use Case: Tell Brak has been destroyed by Akkadians (maybe?) (~2600 BCE)
Type: Destruction (CIDOC E6, maybe E68)
Challenges: Uncertainty of actor. Also, the city is both a real thing (so E6!) and likely a political entity (E68), but maybe just use both?

Use Case: Kish is wiped out during the rise of Akkad (~2300 BCE)
Type: Political Entity Dissolved (E68)
Challenges: The date is locked, but in relationship to another event... there's an uncertainty stack here

Use Case: Rimush of Akkad is assassinated by his court (~2270 BCE)
Type: Assassination/Death (E69, ?)
Challenges: "his court" is not really defined. Assassination doesn't really exist as a CIDOC concept, just death

Use Case: Ur reaches 100,000 people as the first city on the planet (~2100 BCE)
Type: Record (?) (CIDOC unknown)
Challenges: Cool tidbit even in a very macro view of history, but it has no CIDOC code and the weight is hard to figure out

Use Case: Tribe of Judah rebels against Israel under the leadership of David (~1010 BCE)
Type: New Entity (CIDOC E63, Ascent to leadership, E86 leaving)
Challenges: VERY unclear borders in a civil war, the "E86" leaving Israel is tricky because we probably weren't tracking Judah before

Use Case: Ark of the Covenant brought to Jerusalem
Type: Item Move / Religious Event (E9... but that's only a move, not a Religious Event)
Challenges: It might be hard to impress the importance of this event clearly because items move all the time
