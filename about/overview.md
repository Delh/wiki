# Overview

ChronoScio is an interactive open historical atlas:

- It's an **atlas** because all the data we have -territories, events, actors... and more in the future- are presented on a map.
- We focus for now on **historical** political entities, figures and events in our database.
- Everyone can contribute to our project, in the same way as Wikipedia, which makes the database totally **open**.
- And finally, you **interact** with the map by traveling in space on the Google-Maps-like atlas, on in time with the timeline slider.
