# Onboarding

Welcome to ChronoScio! Here is an overview of where you can find information you want, and - if interested - how you can help ChronoScio.

## The Wiki - our knowledge base

If you're reading this page, you're probably reading it from our Wiki, https://chronoscio.github.io/wiki/. This is where you should start.

We put in our Wiki summaries of discussions we had, features we are implementing or planning to implement, tutorials etc. It's a very high-level overview of what ChronoScio is and is not.

## Discord - our chat

If you haven't done so yet, please join us on our public Discord: https://discord.gg/srnDdKd. Our daily conversations are happening there. In particular, read through the `#info` channel first to know about the different channels we have.

If you have any questions that are not answered in the wiki, Discord is the best place to ask them.

## Github - our code and project management

Github is mostly used to host code, and that's what we do, because all code at ChronoScio is open-source. Have a look at these two code repositories if you are interested in the code:

- https://github.com/chronoscio/backend
- https://github.com/chronoscio/frontend

However, we also use Github for general project management. Here are the most interesting parts:

- Project Kanban board: https://github.com/orgs/chronoscio/projects
- Issues concerning hosting, branding, communications, team organization go here: https://github.com/chronoscio/meta
- This Wiki is actually also a repository on its own! You can modify its content here: https://github.com/chronoscio/wiki
