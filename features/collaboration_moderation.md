# Collaboration & Moderation

The ultimate goal of ChronoScio is to be Wikipedia-like, i.e. all content is created and moderated by the community.

## ðŸ’¡ Collaboration

In the long-term, everyone that signs up on ChronoScio should be able to modify all public data, which includes:

- all facts
- all public narratives

The edition history will also be logged. This system is very similar to Wikipedia's [page history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history).

## ðŸ’¡ Moderation

However, before the community gets big enough to moderate itself, we believe that user-inputted data should be moderated, to avoid spam data. Some ideas are:

- let users send an email to ChronoScio to become a contributor, and ChronoScio team quickly has a chat with them to know that they're willing to make useful contributions.
- let anyone input anything, but there's an additional step where ChronoScio team approves/rejects requests.
- let a contributor invite x many other users to be a contributor too.

TBD.
